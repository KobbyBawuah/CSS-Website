      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a recent Carleton University graduate with a degree in Electrical Engineering. 
          I have an understanding of electrical power, electronics, and electromagnetics. 
          I am also enthusiastic about information systems and the evolution of technology in our world.  
          Using certain skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving, I am interested in solving 
          problems by developing essential technologies to better our society.</p>

        <h3>Programming Skills</h3>
        <p> I started learning to code in the late years of high school because I wanted to learn something new. 
            Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web applications.

        <h3>Electrical Skills</h3>
        <p>Electrical engineering was the core of my undergraduate degree. 
            The program instilled the core engineering principles and also taught me to use magnitudes of engineering tools. 
            The most important aspect of the program, I believe, was getting us to learn to critically and 
            analytically think about any subject matter. I also improved my problem-solving capabilities.

        <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
        <p>
            I gained and grew my soft skills in multiple situations. Internships, coupled with a few part-time jobs, 
            and some group projects, enabled me to either display my soft skills or learn the flaws in them. 
            My best skills currently are my self-motivation and time management.
